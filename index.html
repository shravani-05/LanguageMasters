		<h2>C Programming</h2>
		<p>C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.
			It is a very popular language, despite being old.C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to
			 write the UNIX operating system.It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
			 If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python,
			C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python
			C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies.C programming language is a
			machine-independent programming language that is mainly used to create many types of applications and operating systems 
			such as Windows, and other complicated programs such as the Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter, and games and is
			considered a programming foundation in the process of learning any other programming language.
			Operating systems and diverse application software for computer architectures ranging from supercomputers to PLCs and
			embedded systems are examples of such applications.

		<h2>C++ programming</h2>
		<p>C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.
		C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.
		C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.
		The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.
		C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.
		C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.
		C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
		C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
		C++ is fun and easy to learn!As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.

		<h2>Java Programming</h2>
		<p>Java is a widely-used programming language for coding web applications. It has been a popular choice among developers 
			for over two decades, with millions of Java applications in use today. Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and 
			network-centric language that can be used as a platform in itself. It is a fast, secure, reliable programming language 
			for coding everything from mobile apps and enterprise software to big data applications and server-side technologies.
			Java has been around for a long time, so many learning resources are available for new programmers. Detailed documentation, 
			comprehensive books, and courses support developers through the learning curve. In addition, beginners can start writing code 
			in Core Java before moving to Advanced Java.When using Java, developers don’t need to write every new function from scratch.
			Instead, Java provides a rich ecosystem of in-built functions and libraries to develop a range of applications.Java has many 
			active users and a community that can support developers when they face coding challenges.

		<h2>Python</h2>
		<p>This Python Tutorial is very well suited for Beginners, and also for experienced programmers with other programming languages like 
			C++ and Java. This specially designed Python tutorial will help you learn Python Programming Language in the most efficient way, with 
			topics from basics to advanced (like Web-scraping, Django, Deep-Learning, etc.) with examples.Python is a high-level, general-purpose, and very popular programming language. Python programming language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along with all cutting-edge technology in Software Industry.

			Python language is being used by almost all tech-giant companies like – Google, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, Uber… etc.Python is currently the most widely used multi-purpose, high-level programming language, which allows programming in Object-Oriented and Procedural paradigms. Python programs generally are smaller than other programming languages like Java. Programmers have to type relatively less and the indentation requirement of the language, makes them readable all the time.

		<h2>JavaScript</h2>
		<p>JavaScript is a very famous programming language that was originally started in the year of 1995 with the motive of making web pages alive.
			 It is also an essential part of the web developer skillset. In simple terms, if you want to learn web development then learn HTML & CSS 
			 before starting JavaScript.JavaScript was created over a period of several days by Brandan Eich, a Netscape employee, back in September 1995. 
			 Initially called ‘Mocha’, the language’s name was changed to ‘Mona’ and then ‘LiveScript’ before eventually becoming known as ‘JavaScript’. 
			 In 1996, JavaScript was officially given the name of ECMAScript, with ECMAScript 2 coming out in 1998 and ECMAScript 3 following up in 1999.
			  This evolved into today’s JavaScript, which now works not only across different browsers but also on different
			 devices including desktops and mobile devices. In just twenty years or so it’s gone from a primitive programming language to one of the most
			 important tools in a web developer skill set. It’s hard to miss JavaScript if you have worked on the Internet.
